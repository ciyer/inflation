    "In his 1970 Wincott Lecture, Milton Friedman said that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon in the sense that it is and can be produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity.” Maybe this was true given the data he had at his disposal at that time. With the data available now, I think the 2021 version of that statement would be, **“Inflation might in some places and at certain times be a monetary phenomenon. :shrug-emoji:”**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are theoretical reasons why QTM is plausible, but after looking at OECD data for almost 30 countries over a wide range of years, QTM, at least as it is explained to non-economists, is not borne out in the data. The Equation of Exchange, not QTM, explains the Barro data set; hyperinflation is sometimes, but by no means always, preceded by rapid growth of the money supply; and current inflation predicts the trajectory of inflation over the next 5 years better than the growth in the money supply does. In the real world, high inflation can occur before, after, or independently of increases in the money supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "As important as the question of what causes inflation is the question of what to do about it. Take the case of Indonesia 1998 again. A regional neighbor devalues their currency, applying pressure on Indonesia to devalue and inflate. Indonesia reacted by giving in, devaluing and increasing the supply of the Rupiah. Would they have experienced better socio-economic outcomes had they not taken these steps? I would be interested to hear answers by monetarists and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions are not just academic and not just of interest to economists. Every day, new cryptocurrencies are being designed with the intention of replacing cash, and some of these cryptocurrencies have built-in assumptions about inflation and how to limit it. Eventually, cryptocurrencies will be exposed to pressures beyond their control, and a robust monetary design will be imperative to prevent things from going off the rails. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the episode of the [Odd Lots podcast on MMT with Stephanie Kelton](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2021-03-17/how-mmt-won-the-fiscal-policy-debate-podcast), much time is spent discussing inflation and its causes. Around minute 32, Tracy Alloway, asks Kelton to explain her views, and Kelton’s answer is basically, “It’s complicated.” In some ways this is less satisfactory than being able to point to variable X as the cause of inflation, but I think, in its favor, is that “it’s complicated” is a more accurate description of the world."
